            I&apos;ve built products for companies and individuals around the globe ranging from marketing websites to complex solutions and enterprise apps with focus on fast, elegant and accessible user experiences. Currently, I&apos;m studying at <a href="https://www.iitkgp.ac.in">IIT Kharagpur</a> as a Btech UG in my prefinal year.

            Before now, I worked as a CS intern at Tradebot, assisting in the development of trading systems while gaining hands-on experience in industry standards. Prior to that, I have been a part time Bug bounty hunter at <a href= "https://www.hackerone.com">Hackerone</a> and <a href= "https://www.bugcrowd.com">Bugcrowd</a>, reporting vulnerabilities and issuing patches to clients worldwide.
